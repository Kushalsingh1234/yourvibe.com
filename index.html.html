        <div ID="PARA1"> So now when you are here, you should know what is “YourVibe.com". It is a personal website
            made
            by me
            (Kushal). I post all my articles on various social/non- social issues of concern here. You can also find
            the
            stories and books written by me in my early teenage here. You can listen to my motivational podcast
            "Zindagi
            aur Hum” here. Also if you are a fan of Hindi poetry, then this a very good place for you.
            Thank you
            Enjoy Your time</div>

        <div class="paraofbooks"> So you guys already know my name, but still to do the formalities I should repeat it.
            My name is Kushal Singh and I am a part time writer, so I started writing at the age of 14 years in
            lockdown. So the books you see above in the photos are the ones which I wrote in my teenage probably in
            2020-2021. <br><br>
            The Hidden Battle for the nation is a patriotic spy thriller set up in Sweden and Russian countries.<br><br>
            Mark Vendor and the Crime Mytery was my first book. It's a suspense based plot on three friends in a school.
            <br><br>
            The Inspiration was my first and only poetry book. It is mainly dedicated to the rhyming poems on various
            social issues of societal concern. <br><br>
            The Moonlight Smile that Stole my Heart was my first properly love based story, where a love story between
            two tenants develop and strengthen through difficult circumstances.
